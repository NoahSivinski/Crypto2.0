# Crypto2.0
- Idea: Python bot to automatically scrape twitter, reddit, youtube, telegram, etc. for potential early stage meme/alt coins, and automatic alerts if potential coin is found. Simultaneously tracking CoinMarketCap to see if said coin exists, then alerting user and providing information/dashboard(s) for the coin.
- Further functionality: Additionally integrating Quiver Quant dashboards for comparison/trading simulator.
